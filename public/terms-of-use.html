                <p class="italic text-gray-400 mb-6"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a preliminary draft of the Terms of Use for Alliance Forge. This document is a work in progress and is subject to change. The first official and binding version will be released upon the game's official launch.</p>
                <p>By accessing or using our game, Alliance Forge, our website The Nexus (DACI), or any related services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you may not use our Services.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">1. Eligibility and Account Security</h3>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">3. The "Play-and-Own" (P&O) Economy</h3>
                 <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Alliance Forge uses a "Play-and-Own" model where certain in-game items are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that you can truly own.</li>
                    <li>Your ownership of these NFTs is recorded on the Cronos blockchain.</li>
                    <li>The value of NFTs and cryptocurrencies can be volatile. We do not guarantee that any asset you own will have any particular value.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">4. In-Game Assets & Currencies</h3>

                    <li><strong>Auron:</strong> A traditional, off-chain in-game currency earned through gameplay. Auron cannot be traded or converted to on-chain assets.</li>
                    <li><strong>$ALLIANCE:</strong> An on-chain, soulbound (non-transferable) token earned by wallet-connected players. Its only purpose is to be vested for $CYBER.</li>
                    <li><strong>$CYBER:</strong> A fixed-supply, ERC-20 governance and value-accrual token. All high-value assets are traded in $CYBER.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">5. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
