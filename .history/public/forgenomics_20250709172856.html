                    <strong>Preamble & Disclaimer:</strong> This blueprint details the foundational economic system of Alliance Forge. While the core principles outlined here are definitive, this document is subject to refinement prior to the game's official launch. The first binding version of our Terms of Use will be released at launch. Following the official launch, any amendments to this economic system can only be enacted through the Alliance Forge DAO, as stipulated within this codex.

                <p class="mb-6">The Alliance Forge economy is engineered for longevity and resilience. We are building a self-sustaining digital nation, not a short-term speculative bubble. Our primary objective is to create a robust ecosystem that rewards meaningful participation and strategic, long-term investment.</p>

                    <p>At its heart, Alliance Forge is a high-quality, engaging game. We have evolved beyond the flawed "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) model to pioneer a "Play-and-Own" (P&O) system. This approach prioritizes immersive gameplay while offering players true, verifiable ownership of their in-game assets as NFTs. This fosters a deep connection between players and the game world, aligning the success of both developers and the community through perpetual royalties from secondary market sales.</p>

As a non-transferable (soulbound) token with an uncapped supply, $ALLIANCE represents a player's active reputation and in-game achievements. Its sole function is to be deposited into the Vesting Contract for conversion into our core token, $CYBER.</p>
