                    This blueprint details the foundational economic system of Alliance Forge. While the core principles outlined here are definitive, this document is subject to refinement prior to the game's official launch. The first binding version of our Terms of Use will be released at launch. Following the official launch, any amendments to this economic system can only be enacted through the Alliance Forge DAO, as stipulated within this codex.

We are building a self-sustaining digital nation, not a short-term speculative bubble.

                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">At its heart, Alliance Forge is a high-quality, engaging game. We have evolved beyond the flawed "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) model to pioneer a "Play-and-Own" (P&O) system. This approach prioritizes immersive gameplay while offering players true, verifiable ownership of their in-game assets as NFTs. This fosters a deep connection between players and the game world, aligning the success of both developers and the community through perpetual royalties from secondary market sales.</p>
